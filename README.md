# multilingual-bert--Hebrew-Arabic

## Overview

**multilingual-bert--Hebrew-Arabic** is a project focused on creating and fine-tuning a multilingual BERT model specifically for Hebrew and Arabic. This model aims to bridge the gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for these languages, providing robust support for a variety of NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Tailored for both Hebrew and Arabic languages.
- **Pre-trained BERT Model**: Utilizes the BERT architecture for effective language understanding.
- **Fine-tuning**: Capabilities for further training on specific tasks and datasets.
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Fine-tuning the Model

To fine-tune the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased')

# Prepare your dataset
train_texts = ["example sentence in Hebrew", "example sentence in Arabic"]
train_labels = [0, 1]
train_encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Dataset(train_encodings, train_labels)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,   # batch size for training
    save_steps=10_000,               # number of updates steps before checkpoint saves
    save_total_limit=2,              # limit the total amount of checkpoints
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                      # the instantiated ðŸ¤— Transformers model to be trained
    args=training_args,               # training arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=train_dataset,      # training dataset
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### 2. Using the Model

To use the fine-tuned model for predictions:

```python
# Load fine-tuned model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./results')

# Tokenize input
inputs = tokenizer("example sentence in Hebrew or Arabic", return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
```

## Datasets

For training and evaluation, you can use publicly available datasets for Hebrew and Arabic, such as:

- [Hebrew Corpus](https://www.example.com)
- [Arabic Corpus](https://www.example.com)
